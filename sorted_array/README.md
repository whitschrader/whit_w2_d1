## The iterators lab 

This lab builds on your implementation of SortedArray from [The Sorted Array Lab](https://github.com/wdi-sf-jan-2014/sorted_array). Make sure all your specs pass for that lab before starting on this one. The file [sorted_array_spec.rb](sorted_array_spec.rb) has some new specs that you need to satisfy. 

You should notice that some of the spec examples are pending. Fill those
in. Define the functionality for how methods like SortedArray#find ought
to work in terms of spec examples.

Bonus

Implement `SortedArray#inject`. See if you can get it to work exactly
like `Array#inject`.
